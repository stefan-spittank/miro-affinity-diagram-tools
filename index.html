        <h1>miro Affinity Diagram Plugin (AWS)</h1>
        <p class="p-medium">
          This miro plugin is intended for people doing user interviews (User
          Experience Designers, Requirements Engineers,...). It helps importing
          notes from your user interviews, to be able to create an affinity
          diagram in a shared interpretation session. Optionally you can assign a
          user code to each interview you are importing. This could be helpful to
          easily identify the source interview in future discussions.
